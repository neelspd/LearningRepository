## Iris Classifier
A Hobby Project based on machine learning.
The task was to construct a neural network classifier and train it on the Iris data set to predict flower species based on sepal/petal geometry.


The steps involved are,

-> Load datasets available as CSV files

-> Construct a neural network classifier

-> Train the model using the training data

-> Evaluate the accuracy of the model

-> Classify new samples


# Getting Started
Background in Math(Statistics Specially) and Computer science will be usefull. Knowledge in Artificial Intelligence, Data Mining, Machine Learning will be usefull
